  # Dynamic and Static Programming Languages

## Dynamic Programming Languages

Dynamic programming languages are those in which the type of a variable is interpreted at runtime. This means that you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable when you write your code. Examples of dynamic programming languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. These languages are often easier to write and more flexible, but they can be slower and more prone to runtime errors.

### Advantages of Dynamic Programming Languages

- Easier to write and read
- More flexible and adaptable
- Faster development time

### Disadvantages of Dynamic Programming Languages

- Slower execution speed
- More prone to runtime errors
- Harder to debug

## Static Programming Languages

Static programming languages are those in which the type of a variable is known at compile time. This means that you must explicitly declare the type of a variable when you write your code. Examples of static programming languages include C, C++, and Java. These languages are often faster and more reliable, but they can be more difficult to write and less flexible.

### Advantages of Static Programming Languages

- Faster execution speed
- Less prone to runtime errors
- Easier to debug

### Disadvantages of Static Programming Languages

- Harder to write and read
- Less flexible and adaptable
- Longer development time
